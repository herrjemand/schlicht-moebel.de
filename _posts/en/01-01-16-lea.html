title       : LEA
description : "Made out of one-piece solid timber the lamp »Lea« is leaning against the wall. <br>Due to her split legs and the rounding at the upper end, the light can be placed at the wall without any mounting. The curved shape is created through the process of steam bending, a markedly economic solution for a floor lamp. The costs for material are low and the whole production is time conserving as well as environmentally friendly.»Lea« is naturally simple while occupying just a small space for herself. The low but sustainable production procedure reflects the concept of this plain but convenient lamp."
